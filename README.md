In this branch we will be working on the rendering layer of Isaac.

We will use OpenGL (GLFW + GLAD) to render the objects in Kernel directory.

Our main focus will be to maximize abstraction for rendering the shapes.

Once done with this, We will move on to create a user interface with Dear ImGui
and then finally finish the rest of objects in Kernel directory to make a working
2-D Prototype.
