In this branch, We will be working on creating mathematical objects like vectors that the engine of Isaac will be using to show how objects evolve over time.
The implementations will be regularly modified in the hope that we can optimize them for performance gains. Since the other external libraries that we will be using
can only have minor performance improvements, We will ensure that these classes do not further bottleneck the performance.
