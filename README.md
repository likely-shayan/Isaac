<h1 align='center'>Introduction</h1>

<p align='justify'>
<b>Isaac</b> is a cross-platform computer software that can be used to create interactive and visually-pleasing simulations of pre-defined physical objects under the effect of various forces that follow the laws of Newtonian mechanics. While the governing laws cannot be changed, we can change the various physical constants in Newtonian mechanics such as acceleration due to gravity or the gravitational constant to see how those system look like under the new conditions. Currently, The focus is on building a prototype that can supports only 2D simulations.

<h2 align='center'>What Isaac is built on:</h2>
<p align='justify'>
Isaac uses Eigen library for performing various computations common in linear algebra, numerical integration and other mathematical operations commonly used throughout Newtonian mechanics. For rendering, Isaac uses OpenGL to render all the objects and how they evolve through time in frames. As for GUI, Isaac uses Qt to create the easy-to-use but highly customizable interface to create the simulations.

<h2 align='center'>Our gift to the Open-Source community</h2>
<p align='justify'>
Since free and open-source software have helped tremendously in the development of Isaac, We have decided that Isaac is going to be a completely free and open-source software. 
</p>

<h2 align='center'>Future plans</h2>
<p align='justify'>
If Isaac is met with lots of love and more contributors, then we will also begin working on more optimized version of Isaac as well as similar software for other domains of physics such as fluid mechanics and electromagnetism along with customized versions of them made specifically for students, teachers and professional researchers.
